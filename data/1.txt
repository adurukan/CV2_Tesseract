Bitcoin and the crypto market have been of late seeing most prices of crypto in red, with little hope for
an uptrend, at least based on charts. The past few weeks have seen growing fear and doubt about the
asset class.

However, despite the recent trend in the market, the primary crypto asset, Bitcoin, is recording an
increase in whale transactions. The big shots have gathered more BTC in the past fortnight, valued at
hundreds of millions of dollars.
