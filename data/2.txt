Santiment reported that Bitcoinâ€™s addresses holding between 100 to 10,000 BTC tokens are still
purchasing more. Furthermore, the firm mentioned that these addresses had witnessed rapid growth
over the three weeks.

The analytics company cited that about 159 new addresses have been holding between 100 to 10,000
BTC over the last three weeks. According to the data, this is the fastest growth such addresses have
experienced in 10 months.

Aswing in the addresses could be linked to FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) brought about by the
ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.
